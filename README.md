                                               QuickSort Execution Time Lab
  
**Big O Runtime**

(say how it kinda looks like o(n^2) and how it looks for the best, worst, average/most likely case
                                             
                                             
**Hypothesis**

**Background**

**Methodology**

We tested how different array sizes and arrangements would effect the execution time. We started with arrays that were of size 100 and incremented it by 100 until it reached 1000. We did that for arrays that were arranged randomly, in ascending order, and in descending order. We tested the arrays twice for each arrangement to test the best (when the pivot position is at the middle) and worst case (when the pivot position is at one of the ends). To test different pivot positions, we added another helper method to QuickSort.java.

**Results**

We included the results from one run of the code in a Spreadsheet linked below and in the three line graphs.
